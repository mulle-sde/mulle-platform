**mulle-platform** lets you query the current platform for such things like the
extension of shared libraries or the location of specific libraries.

For example `mulle-platform search dl` returns
`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.a` on my linux system.

> You might be better off to use **cmake** for such things. But this
> command can be handy in shell scripts.
